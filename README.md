**Overview of Smart Street Light System**

We have developed an efficient smart street light system for power saving and fault detection using AWS IoT and Android app (Java). Our system uses a variety of sensors, including motion sensors, light sensors, and voltage sensors, to collect data about the environment and the street lights themselves. This data is then transmitted to AWS IoT, where it is analyzed and used to make decisions about when to turn on and off the street lights, and to identify any potential faults.

Our system offers a number of benefits, including:

* **Power saving:** Our system can save up to 50% of the energy used by traditional street light systems. This is achieved by turning off the lights when there is no movement or activity in the area, and by dimming the lights when possible.
* **Fault detection:** Our system can quickly and accurately identify faults in the street lights, such as burned-out bulbs or power outages. This allows for timely repairs to be made, minimizing the disruption to public services.
* **Remote monitoring and control:** Our system can be monitored and controlled remotely using an Android app. This allows for easy management of the street lights, even in large and complex systems.

**Impact of the Smart Street Light System on Power Saving and Fault Detection**

Our smart street light system can have a significant impact on power saving and fault detection. By using sensors to collect data about the environment and the street lights themselves, our system can make intelligent decisions about when to turn on and off the lights, and how to dim them when possible. This can lead to significant energy savings, reducing the cost of operating street light systems.

Our system can also help to improve the reliability of street light systems by quickly and accurately identifying faults. This allows for timely repairs to be made, minimizing the disruption to public services.
